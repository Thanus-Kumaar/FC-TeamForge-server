/*
  formTeams(players, formation) is a function that assigns each player to one of two teams.
  The position assignment is based on their position category and the formation.

  The position categories are: Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Attacker
    
  Players that canâ€™t be placed immediately into the correct position are added to a remaining_players set.
  They are then assigned to fill empty positions in a later pass through.

  In total there are 3 passes for assignment of positions:
    Pass 1 - Assign players to their exact position in their category.
    Pass 2 - Assign players to any position in their category.
    Pass 3 - Assign players to any open position.
